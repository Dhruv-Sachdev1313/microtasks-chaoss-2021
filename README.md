# CHAOSS-GSoC-2021: Develop a Shared Data Resource Focused on Dependencies, Risk and Vulnerabilities in Open Source Software
Repository for CHAOSS Microtasks. 

## About Me
I am a second year Computer Engineering Student at Mumbai University.I am expected to graduate in June 2023. I have interest in data analysis. I can code in C/C++, dart, python, javascript. I also have some knowledge about pandas, numpy, matplotlib.Apart from this ,I have intermediate knowledge in frameworks like Django and Flutter(for cross-platform mobile apps).

## MicroTasks
- [x] **Microtask 0:** Download and configure Augur, creating a dev environment using the general cautions noted here: https://oss-augur.readthedocs.io/en/dev/getting-started/installation.html and the full documentation here: https://oss-augur.readthedocs.io/en/dev/development-guide/toc.html
- [x] **Microtask 1:** Work on any Augur Issue that's Open - Worked on issues [#1155](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/issues/1155) and [#1219](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/issues/1219) and made PRs [#1195](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/pull/1195) and [#1220](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/pull/1220) respectively



- [x] **Microtask 2:** Identify new issues you encounter during installation. -
I made an issue on augur github repository regarding issues that I faced during installation [#1134](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/issues/1134)

- [x] **Microtask 3:** Build a jupyter notebook to identify software dependencies, or build software dependency metrics using one of the identified tools. - Link to the jupyter notebook github - https://github.com/Dhruv-Sachdev1313/microtasks-chaoss-2021/blob/main/dependencies_analysis.ipynb. But Since sometime github jupyter viewing tool doesn't work so if you want only to view jupyter notebook, you can use this link - https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Dhruv-Sachdev1313/microtasks-chaoss-2021/blob/main/dependencies_analysis.ipynb 

- [x] **Microtask 4:** Anything you want to show us. Even if you find bugs in our documentation and want to issue a PR for those!  -   I think in the augur documentation we can show them to make their user, super user by ` ALTER USER myuser WITH SUPERUSER; `  for anyone who would be creating the databse while running ` make install ` by choosing the option 1 .
